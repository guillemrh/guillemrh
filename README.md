Hi, I’m @guillemrh — Data Engineer with a chemical-engineering past and a growing obsession with backend systems, distributed data, and anything that scales without crying.

I’ve spent the last few years building ETLs, PySpark pipelines, and cloud/data architectures. These days I’m leveling up toward backend + AI engineering with a focus on clean architecture, real deployments, and projects that don’t fall apart when Docker sneezes.

Tech: Azure, PySpark, Python, SQL, Snowflake, Power BI, Oracle, Docker, and whatever else gets the job done fast.

On this GitHub you’ll find modular, realistic projects that help me sharpen engineering fundamentals and build a portfolio aimed at future roles.
